## About Me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

I am a Research Assistant at the [Chair of Political Economy](http://polecon.sowi.uni-mannheim.de) at the University of Mannheim where I taught and conducted research in political economy, and received my PhD in 2018.

In my research, I use game-theory and data to explain political strategies under authoritarianism. My dissertation focuses on the question how authoritarian regimes use political and economic institutions to control access to political offices. 
Further, I am interested in the question how natural resources affect political behaviour of officials and private citizens in both democracies and non-democracies. 

Methodologically, I use hierarchichal models in Bayesian and frequentist frameworks and quasi-experimental methods for prediction, analysis and inference, as well as web-scraping and natural language processing for the data extraction.
