career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a researcher interested in data-driven answers and solution to societal, especially political problems. 
      I hold a doctoral degree in Political Science in which I focused on the political economy of authoritarian politics. 
      Also, I am interested in quantitative text analysis, quasi-experimental methods, measurement models and web-scraping.


education:
    - degree: Doctorate in Political Science
      university: University of Mannheim
      time: 2014 - 2018
      details: |
        In my dissertation, I used screening and bargaining models to explain how governments influence 
        political competition in authoritarian and transitioning countries. I tested these explanations using quasi-experimental
        correlational research designs using original data. Other research interests include:
            
           - the political economy of natural resources
           - central banking
           - quantitative text analysis and natural language processing
          
    - degree: MSc in Public Policy
      university: University College London
      time: 2013 - 2014
      details: |
        I studied how economic and political actors and institutions affect the policy-making process. My thesis analysed the
        effects of state-owned investment funds on fiscal policy-making.

    - degree: BA in Philosophy &amp; Economics
      university: University of Bayreuth
